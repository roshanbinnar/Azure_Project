Title â€“ Scalable ETL Pipeline with Parameterized Ingestion in Azure 

Summary 
Designed and implemented an end-to-end cloud data engineering solution on Azure, focusing 
on scalable data ingestion, storage, and transformation. The project leveraged parameterized 
pipelines for dynamic and reusable workflows, following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, 
Silver, Gold) to deliver analytics-ready datasets. 

Description 

-Built an automated data pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest data from multiple 
sources (HTTP, SQL). 
- Stored and organized data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS) with Hierarchical 
Namespace (HNS) for optimized structure and querying.
- Implemented parameterized ingestion pipelines, enabling reusability and dynamic source 
integration.
- Applied Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) for scalable and reliable data 
analytics.
